# TEST 1: Checking all temperature sensors

By logging into the TerraBot, we could view live the value of all the sensors.

- This would test if the sensor is malfunctioning if there is dissimilarity between the temperature sensors.

Using logs, check if it is a sudden spike or a gradual increase in temperature. 

- If there was a spike in the temperature (say, current temperature is 2 times higher than temperature from 30 minutes ago), there is more evidence for sensor malfunction.

- Otherwise, there is more evidence towards outside factors that caused temperature increase. 


# TEST 2: Check if the actuators or a behavior is what caused the temperature to rise

Use the logs to view which behaviors are active/inactive during the temperature spike.

- Seeing which behaviors are active/inactive leads us to view which actuators are inactive/active as well as the double-checking conditions for behaviors (e.g. behaviors are in the correct state if it’s a finite state model, value thresholds, etc.)

This would indicate if it the sensor or the code that’s messing up

- If there is an actuator command that would cause the rise in temperature (e.g. LED increase) then the problem is with the code rather than the sensor.

- If there isn’t that would indicate a sensor malfunction 


# TEST COMPARISON

The second test is better, because it captures more meaningful information behind
conditions that cause the temperature increase if it occurs. If the issue was due 
to a behavior, then the first test would not be able to uncover this, while the 
second test would. It’s also possible that all sensors malfunction which the first 
test can’t capture.


# PROS VS. CONS

Pros

- More meaningful interpretations of why the temperature increase occurred

- Able to know which behavior(s) contributed to the temperature increase

-Able to create diagnosing behavior depending on which behavior(s) failed. 

- Able to capture cases where both temperature sensors.

Cons 

- If the sensor malfunctioned, the first test would be quicker to diagnose, while the second test would take longer to figure out.
